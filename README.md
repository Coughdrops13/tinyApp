# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

If you are reading this, the market is flooded with TinyApps; that is because we believe that every person should have their own completely unique and independent version of any app that they use. Is this necessary? Absolutely not. But every TinyApp created today pushes the date of the machine take-over back by at least 30 min.
